She says that she wants to be as authentic as possible on </span><i><span>Million Dollar Listing</span></i><span>. "I don't want to be the female on the show that's regarded and protected and minding my manners," she says. "I feel like if I'm not as authentic, and I can't make mistakes, and I can't fail and you can't see me have a difficult time and recover, but also continue to be successful, then you're not really sending the picture to the rest of the universe that you can be a successful woman. You can be funny, you can be crass, you can be sexy, you can be tender, you can be a mother, you can be a wife or you can be sex-positive. The truth is, you can be all of those things! And you can still be successful. That's the message that I want to get across. I don't want to put on a three-piece suit and be buttoned-up. I want to be able to wear what I want to wear and be just as empowered and sexy and smart as if I was in a three-piece men's suit."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/shutterstock_1488795377.jpg><p><span>Tutor tells In The Know that she ignores hateful comments. "The truth is, that it's not like it doesn't come with its moments where you read some nasty comment and it starts to penetrate," she says. "And then I just realize, 'You know what? I'm happy!' I don't know if it's forever. That's not what it needs to be! I want to live in the moment. And I want to embrace the joy that I'm feeling."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/GettyImages-1245471353.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In her In The Know interview</span></a><span>, Tutor opened up about her relationship with co-star, Heather. She says that she is all about supporting other women. "That's always been my MO," Tutor says. "I'm like, 'girl power. Oh yeah. All the way.' And so I don't believe in competition like that. I believe in lifting each other up, you know, and celebrating each other's successes, and that's been fun."</span></p><p><span>Tutor has a busy life. However, her life is always pretty straightforward. She is all about having a daily routine and structure. Tutor broke down her routine to Business Insider, and shared the article </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>on Instagram</span></a><span>. Tutor captioned the post, "Your daily routine matters. Find one that works for you and stick with it."</span></p><p><span>Tutor's schedule is busy, which means she has to find time to workout. She tells Business Insider that she likes to workout in the morning for this reason. Tutor says that she tries to start her exercise at 6:15 AM each day. "An hour on the treadmill accompanied by calls and emails. Followed by 45 minutes of strength training or Pilates."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkraqRmMZuwNStpqtlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKyYsqtdo7xussilq56qXaO8brzRqJmlnZ1k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
