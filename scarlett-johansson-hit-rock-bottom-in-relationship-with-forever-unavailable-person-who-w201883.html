Why am I standing outside this bar at 1:30 in the morning texting while my friends are inside?'” she told <i>Cosmo.</i> “‘Or taking a taxi to see him at some ungodly hour? This isn’t me.’ That is the moment you’ve gotta cut it off. Otherwise, it will keep coming back, suck your blood.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>While Johansson didn’t drop any specific names, the Oscar nominee has a rather rich and complex history with some of Hollywood’s highest-profile hotties. She</span><a href=#> famously dated <b>Josh Hartnett</b></a><b></b><span> from 2005 to 2007, but the two ultimately split over distance and differing commitments. “At the end of the day we’re just ordinary people, and it didn’t work,” Hartnett said in a subsequent interview with the&nbsp;</span><i><a href=#>Mirror UK</a></i><span>, adding that the split itself was “really painful.”</span></p><p>She went on to marry Ryan Reynolds in 2008, and the two split in 2011 after three years of marriage. He remarried <b>Blake Lively</b> in September 2012, and the two share a 15-month-old daughter. After splitting from Reynolds, Johansson briefly dated<b> Sean Penn </b>in 2011, followed by NYC ad executive Nate Naylor in 2012. Then, she met Dauriac.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>Johansson was also linked to </span><b>Lena Dunham</b><span>‘s current boyfriend, fun. guitarist </span><b>Jack Antonoff</b><span>, back in 2001, and she briefly dated </span><b>Jared Leto</b><span> in early 2004.</span></p><p>While her dating life has garnered countless headlines, Johansson (wearing a dress by Christian Siriano on the cover) wanted to spotlight more important issues<i>&nbsp;</i>during her interview with <i>Cosmo.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Scarlett Johansson" width=1000 height=1381 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>“There are countries at war, there’s terrorism, global warming, and we’re like, ‘We should definitely cut the budget for Planned Parenthood. Let’s take away the availability of women’s health initiatives!'” Johansson griped to the mag. “It’s nuts. We’re talking about preventing cervical and breast cancers. Growing up, I used [PP’s] services. All my girlfriends did — not just for birth control but for Pap smears and breast exams. You read about the rise of back-alley abortions, women having to mutilate themselves and teenagers having to seek help in unsafe conditions, and for what?! We’re moving backward when we’re supposed to be moving forward.”</span></p><p>The May 2016 issue of<i> Cosmo</i> hits stands on April 12.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasm5GnuabA02ahqKCRo8C0u81mn6KsXae8pLeMm6atrJ%2Bieqq6jKucpZmknryvv8eip2avmam1brLOq5yvnaJiwq%2Bt1ZqgpZmSobJuvMSrqqimXay1sHnWa2dqcGhofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
