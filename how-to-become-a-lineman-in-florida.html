To advance to becoming a Journeyman <b>Lineman</b>, it is helpful to have at least a two-year associate’s technical degree or certification from a trade school.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-hard-is-it-to-become-a-lineman></span>How hard is it to become a lineman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It’s a great career, and yes it is very <b>hard</b>. You must be both physically strong, pretty sharp mentally and willing to be uncomfortable for long periods of time. It doesn’t matter if it’s 12 degrees and sleeting, or 105 with 90% humidity, the job has to get done.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-worth-going-to-lineman-school></span>Is it worth going to lineman school?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Even when you make journeyman, it’s <b>going</b> to be several years before you are seasoned and have a good grasp on what is <b>going</b> on in every type of situation.

Around 30 to 50 workers in every 100, 000 are killed on the <b>job</b> every year. Many others suffer non-fatal loss of limbs from electrical burns and mechanical trauma.
