Alexis had a little 8 lb girl and she’s named Kai. I really like that name. Ryan was said to have been with Alex at the hospital when she gave birth.</p><p>Ryan Phillippe’s ex girlfriend has given birth to a girl.</p><p>Aspiring actress Alexis Knapp, 26, welcomed a 8lb baby named Kai on July 1, America’s In Touch magazine reports.</p><p>The Cruel Intentions star, 36, is said to have been by her side in the delivery room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, despite questions surrounding the paternity of the child.</p><p>‘It was a smooth delivery,’ an insider tells the publication.</p><p>The actor, who has two children Ava, 11, and Deacon, 7, with his ex wife Reese Witherspoon, has been involved in the pregnancy.</p><p>‘Ryan took Alexis to her last doctor’s appointments and was there in the hospital when she gave birth,’ the source added.</p><p>‘He’s waiting for the DNA test to see of he’s the father, but he’s acting like he is.’</p><p>Knapp dated Phillippe last summer, before splitting in October.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>]</p><p>That’s kind of sweet and makes me have a soft spot for Ryan. He could have shown up after the birth but he made an effort to be there. I also like that someone just told In Touch and didn’t make a big announcement to People or US Weekly. Alexis seems to have a relationship with the tabloid, as they also ran a brief story about how <a href=#>he gave her $5,000 worth of baby gifts</a> ahead of the birth. I forsee some staged baby pictures with Alexis and Kai soon. She seems to have <a href=#>called the paps</a> at least once when Ryan took her to the doctor.</p><p>I like the name Kai and am trying to remember (search on) which other celebrities have children named Kai, which is kind of a gender-neutral name. <a href=#>Jennifer Connolly has a 13 year-old son named Kai</a>, from a relationship before she married Paul Bettany. Google reveals that Colleen and Wayne Rooney (British football player) <a href=#>had a son they named Kai in 2009</a>. And Kaiser reminded me that <a href=#>Parminder Nagra also has a son named Kai</a> and that Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber named their son Samuel Kai. So it sounds like it is mostly used for boys, but I do like it for a little girl too. I wonder if Ryan helped Alexis pick out the name. Congratulations to them!</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/alexis.jpg alt=alexis title=alexis width=600 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/54399pcn_alexis17-682x1024.jpg alt=54399pcn_alexis17-682x1024 title=54399pcn_alexis17-682x1024 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo of pregnant Alexis credit: Pedro Andrade/Gaz Shirley, Pacific Coast News.
