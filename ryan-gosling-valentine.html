I am who I am because of you. You are every reason, every hope, and every dream I’ve ever had, and no matter what happens to us in the future, everyday we are together is the greatest day of my life. I will always be yours.”</p><p>Anyone swooning about how perfect that love letter that is? &nbsp;We are, and even though it was said from a character in a popular romance novel and film, the actor who played Noah Calhoun is just as lovely as the character.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/why-ryan-gosling-is-your-perfect-valentine-01-e1454607384945.jpg alt="Why Ryan Gosling is Your Perfect Valentine 1" width=400 height=435 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Yep, Ryan Gosling is kind of incredible, and definitely someone we’d love to have as our valentine this year. &nbsp;From his incredible smile, to his voice (he sings, it’s beautiful, <a href=#>check it out</a>), to the way his eyes sort of invite you in to get lost forever, and the fact that he’s all tall and muscly – he’s definitely perfect. &nbsp;Ryan Gosling has been laying low a bit – after the birth of his child he definitely took some time to be more of a father and less of a celebrity but at the end of 2015 he was in the film The Big Short and has at least two films in post production for 2016! &nbsp;We’re waiting to see his face on the big screen again – soon!</p><p>While we want for more new endeavors, let’s look at five reasons Ryan Gosling is everyone’s perfect valentine.</p><h3>5. He’s handsome – like so SO handsome<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Ryan-Gosling-Do-You-Find-Me-Attractive-Stupid-Crazy-Love.gif alt width=500 height=229 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Okay, so this may be a little bit superficial, but can you blame us? &nbsp;Ryan Gosling is one of the most beautiful humans to ever exist. &nbsp;He’s got these killer blue eyes and a fantastic jawline and if you’ve somehow managed to live without watching The Notebook or Crazy Stupid Love – he’s got killer abs to, like the kind you can wash clothes on. &nbsp;He’s even got cute ears. &nbsp;Okay, we’re done (not really, but we’re shutting up!)</p><h3>4. He’s got a lovely heart</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media2.giphy.com/media/aXLV11Vd37L8Y/giphy.gif alt width=500 height=271 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ryan is one of those actors who you never hear bad press about. &nbsp;Anyone who works with him has great things to say about his personality on and off set. &nbsp;That’s an important quality to have in a person, especially of circumstance, the ability to remain level headed and kind hearted. &nbsp;Ryan encompasses that. &nbsp;He has also worked with a number of charities to improve the lives of the less fortunate; focusing heavily on Darfur and other underprivileged countries. &nbsp;He has time to be an actor, a friend, a father, and an advocate – what a well rounded guy.</p><h3>3. He loves animals<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.technologytell.com/entertainment/files/2014/11/ryan-gosling-with-dog.gif alt width=500 height=260 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h3><p>Ryan’s dog is George is his best pal, but that’s not where his love for animals ends. &nbsp;Ryan has been part of many charities that help not only people, but their four legged friends as well. &nbsp; He spent some time working with PETA and he’s spent time writing letters to major corporations about buying their products from companies that mistreat and abuse animals. &nbsp;So Ryan is an advocate for livestock, is against the mistreatment of animals, and his dog George is his other half – we’re still swooning.</p><h3>2. He’s a wonderful father<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luo18xQnDe1qcavjwo1_500.gif alt width=500 height=231 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h3><p>Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes have yet to share a photo of their child but they have been seen with the young girl (all dressed as skeletons on Halloween) and Ryan looked totally comfortable with the role of dad. &nbsp;He and Eva have both taken some time off from Hollywood to spend time with their little one and if that doesn’t show his commitment to being an active, incredible father – what does?</p><h3>1. He’s actually kind of become a superhero<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.sbnation.com/assets/3488723/ryan-gosling-ryan-gosling-25562937-500-217.gif alt width=500 height=217 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h3><p>Ryan Gosling probably didn’t wake up&nbsp;and decided be a hero but it happened twice now (that we’re aware of). &nbsp;In 2011 Ryan broke up a <a href=#>street fight</a>&nbsp;after swooping in out of just about nowhere and put an end to a brawl in the middle of the street. &nbsp;Then in 2012 he saved a young woman from being <a href=#>hit by a taxi</a> as she was from London and didn’t look in the right direction to see the car coming. &nbsp;There’s something that could be said about being in the right place at the right time, and that’s definitely part of it; but Ryan Gosling also has that whole under over king of the universe thing going on so – there’s that too.</p><p>So if you’re looking for a valentine this February, we don’t blame you for picking Ryan Gosling, just know we’re ahead of you in line, but you can wait with us and we’ll share some candy hearts, okay?!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kv7qtzWaeqKucnruoedWao56mpJ67pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
