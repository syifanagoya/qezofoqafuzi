He was also properly informed that if he disobeyed this order, harassment charges would be brought against him.</p><p>Tragically, the victim went back to the authorities four days later with more proof of Ricke’s persistent harassment, showing that he had ostensibly disregarded the first warning.</p><p>Following this, Kyle was charged, arrested, and a no-contact order was subsequently obtained on August 28.</p><p>Ricke is currently facing legal action, and his trial in Kossuth County court is planned for November 3rd.
