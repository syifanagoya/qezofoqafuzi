So here's a good one: This girl that liked me used to call my house and hang up. This happened almost daily, so when we got a caller ID, I called her back...(I didn't know it was her until we got it...) I was at a friends house who lived across the street from her, and since you could block your number, I called her after her mom left and started talking to her like the guy from "Scream". Mind you, I could see into the window to her living room, which pretty much let you see the whole front of the house...<p>Me: "What are you doing?"<br>Her: "Who is this??"<br>Me: "You know who it is... You wore that nice little black dress for me, I see..."<br>Her: "Ummm, how the fuck do you know what I'm wearing?"<br>Me: "How else would I know... I can see you. Standing in your living room, looking out the window..."<br>Her: "Seriously... Who the fuck is this? I'm gonna call the cops..."<br>Me: "*Maniacal Laugh*... Don't do that... They'll never get here in time anyways. I just wanna have a little fun... Does your mom always leave at 4 'oclock?"<br>Her: "Where are you? I don't see anybody... Mary, is it you? You're fucking stupid..."<br>Me: "It isn't Mary, but I'll give you 3 guesses... You'll NEEEEEEEEVER guess who it is..."<br>Her: "This is stupid... I'm not even scared. It's gotta be Ramon then... Stop fucking around!"<br>Me: "Wrong... I'll go ahead and count that as your second guess, but make the 3rd one good! It's your last chance!.... Do you think hiding in the kitchen is really gonna help?"</p><p>At this point, I walk out onto my buddy's porch and lean over the rail...</p><p>Her: "I'm hanging up. You're fucking stupid. You need to stop watching stupid ass movies... (She's crying...)</p><p>Me: "Why don't you look across the street? What do you see?"</p><p>She looks at me and I smile and wave, blow her a kiss, and say "See? You call my house and hang up, I gotta have some fun with you!"</p><p>There's really no humor here, but I will say this... I did end up falling in love with this girl and she ended up dying in a car accident about 2 years later... Yeah, definitely no humor here... But it was fun at the time...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien6fCrr%2BNsKmeq6Shsru7zZ5lnKedZMGpvsSam6xnoKeur7eMnJilpKNjfnKClXFraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
