When your sewage line becomes blocked, water is unable to pass through it and down the drain. Instead, it returns to the top of the pipes and exits via the lowest position, which is generally the shower drain. A blocked sewage line may be the cause of bubbling (gurgling) in the toilet or an increase in the water level in the toilet.
Is it possible for excrement to block a shower drain in light of this?</description></item><item><title>Singer MO Explains &amp;quot;Issues&amp;quot; With Iggy Azalea SNL Performance</title><link>/singer-mo-explains-issues-with-iggy-azalea-snl-performance-20142710.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/singer-mo-explains-issues-with-iggy-azalea-snl-performance-20142710.html</guid><description>Iggy Azalea‘s debut performance of her new song “Beg for It” left fans begging for an explanation.
