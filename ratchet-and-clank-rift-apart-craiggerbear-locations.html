We’ll show you how to find <strong data-v-0018b8c2>all CraiggerBear locations</strong> in this guide, as well as what reward you'll get for finding all of them.</p><p data-v-0018b8c2><strong data-v-0018b8c2>Read More: </strong><a href=# data-v-0018b8c2>Everything You Need to Know About Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart</a></p><h2 id=aj55c1cfac0bcc data-v-0018b8c2>All CraiggerBear Locations in Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>There are nine CraiggerBears in different locations in Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart. They are small stuffed toys placed in specific areas, with one in each of the nine major planets. There’s no way to narrow down where to find them beyond simple exploring, as they don’t show up on the map for any reason whatsoever. Fortunately, we’ve gone out and found them all for you and listed their locations below.</p><h2 id=aj6f35dd5a8f92 data-v-0018b8c2>Corson V</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>The first CraiggerBear is located in Nefarious City, and it is very easy to access from the moment you’re there. Head to the dead-end area with the pocket dimension to the Northeast of the main market. It's directly opposite to you on the counter of the market stall operated by the round robot just ahead.</p><h2 id=aj273488c5e47e data-v-0018b8c2>Sargasso</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>The CraiggerBear in Sargasso is actually in Rivet’s base, accessed from the path to the East of the Morts’ factory. Once you get inside, head up to the living area with the huge window (destroyed if you’ve reached a certain point in the campaign). There’s a TV and sofa in the centre of the room, with the CraiggerBear sitting comfortably on the sofa, waiting to be claimed.</p><h2 id=ajaaf1cffc1642 data-v-0018b8c2>Scarstu Debris Field</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>The CraiggerBear at Zurkie’s is another incredibly easy one to find. Simply walk into the reception area just outside the bar, and the bear will be resting on a crate just to the left of the Maitre D’.</p><h2 id=ajeb1ce020988e data-v-0018b8c2>Savali</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>This one was a nightmare to find, but once you know where it is, it’s not too difficult to reach. Once you have the upgraded hover boots and can race around the Mesa quickly, head to the Mountain Shrine in the lower-right hand corner of the map. There’s a story challenge here about passing the Mountain trails, which involves using the boots to cross stone paths before they collapse.</p><p data-v-0018b8c2>Once you’ve passed the first path, you’ll be at the Southeast corner of the Mountain Shrine. Rather than turn to your right and continue the trials, keep heading South down a little extended outcrop. The CraiggerBear is waiting at the very end among some pots.</p><h2 id=aj5166984a52a8 data-v-0018b8c2>Blizar Prime</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>This one can be reached early on in your first exploration of Blizar Prime. Head to the room split in half by the glass partition at the bottom of the map, where you can use the console to override the lockdown. The CraiggerBear is in the West side of the room, but only if you’re in the intact, populated dimension, not the destroyed one.</p><p data-v-0018b8c2>If you're looking for more help with Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, be sure to visit our <a href=# data-v-0018b8c2>Rift Apart Walkthrough Hub</a>. You'll be able to find every guide we have on the game so far.</p><h2 id=ajacaa039040db data-v-0018b8c2>Torren IV</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>Another basic one, though a little more hidden. In the centre of the Vullard’s town is a long “high street” with the Ms. Zurkon on the left. The CraiggerBear is on the opposite side, on the first stall on the right as you enter the street.</p><h2 id=aj5cc624fb396e data-v-0018b8c2>Cordelion</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>This CraiggerBear is on the section above sea level in the abandoned dimension, half buried in a snowdrift. Head to the central platform above the water in the abandoned dimension and go to the East side, just before the ramp heading up. Look back to see the CraiggerBear in need of a hot water bottle.</p><h2 id=ajc509f821c1ff data-v-0018b8c2>Ardolis</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>Perhaps suitably, the CraiggerBear at the Ardolis Pirate Base is found at the very end of the Pirate trials on the Northwest island. Head through all three to the 'reward area' after the third one, where they’ll be a bored-looking pirate bot manning a stall. The bear is to the left of him, in a little sandy display next to a treasure chest.</p><h2 id=ajaaa96297f37e data-v-0018b8c2>Viceron</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>The final CraiggerBear is at Zordoom Prison, specifically on a bench in the holding cells in the Processing Facility where characters like the Phantom and Captain Quantum were being held. You’ll engineer a breakout as part of your first visit here, and once you do, head back to that cell. You’ll now be able to enter it, with the bear waiting to be collected. Hooray!</p><h2 id=aj7c46e9153924 data-v-0018b8c2>CraiggerBear Rewards</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>For finding all the CraiggerBears, players simply get a Trophy called “UnBEARably Awesome”. This is a gold trophy that’s also one of the hardest to get in the game. However, there’s no mechanical reward attached to the CraiggerBears, such as a better gun or new ability, as there is with the other collectibles in the game.</p><h2 id=ajdf11419561f1 data-v-0018b8c2>CraiggerBears Explained</h2><p data-v-0018b8c2>CraiggerBears are a new feature to the Ratchet and Clank series, and their presence here seems to be pretty clear as a tribute to acclaimed Insomniac artist Craig Goodman. Goodman worked at the company for fifteen years and <a href=# data-v-0018b8c2>tragically passed away in 2019</a>. CraiggerBears can be found mentioned in the Gallery section of the menu, with an entry that reads as follows:</p><p data-v-0018b8c2>“Mysterious plush bears that seem to show up on every world. They are said to carry the optimism, kindness, and creativity of a fallen hero missed by his comrades.”</p><p data-v-0018b8c2>If you’re looking for the full compilation of collectables in Rift Apart, you should try looking for <a href=# data-v-0018b8c2>all the Gold Bolts, which we’ve got outlined here</a>.
