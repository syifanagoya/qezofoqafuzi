At this point… not so much. For me, the “Goop Too Far” was her story about <a href=#>“everybody scrambling for a razor”</a> when she tried on the Berardi dress without panties. Meaning that Gwyneth now promotes her films by talking about her the size and hirsuteness of her bush. So what was next on Gwyneth’s TMI Tour? A stop on Chelsea Lately, where Chelsea Handler did the heavy lifting and told the audience about Gwyneth’s “advice” to ladies fighting with their men. I’ll spare you the build-up: if you’re mad at your man, don’t yell at him, just go down on him. Goop-Style (Goop-Style = pinkies in the air as you stroke).</p><p></p><p>She paints herself as a domestic goddess, and once encouraged people to ‘nourish the inner aspect’ on her pretentious Goop lifestyle website. But it seems even perfect Gwyenth Paltrow is not always brimming with such lofty words of wisdom.</p><p>In a new interview it emerged the 40-year-old actress, who is married to Coldplay singer Chris Martin, once advised a female friend that oral sex was the solution for women wanting to prevent an argument with their husbands. The Iron Man 3 actress didn’t volunteer this story willingly, but was left red faced after chat show host Chelsea Handler made the revelation as she made an appearance on her show on Monday night.</p><p>Paltrow was having dinner with friends, including Handler, when the unnamed woman told them she was furious with her spouse after a huge bust up. But according to Handler, Gwyneth told her to let go of her anger – before giving her the unusual advice.</p><p><a href=#>[From The Mail]</a></p><p>See, all of this time, I only thought of beejs in peasant terms, as a gift you give when YOU need to get out of trouble. It turns out that all of us should be handing out beejs whenever our dudes piss us off. Which is a really terrible way to exist in any relationship – that’s positive reinforcement of bad behavior. All your man will learn is that he can act like an a—hole and you’ll still give him beejs. It’s like giving your dog a treatie for piddling on the carpet. Classic GOOP.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FFN_AAR_BlueBookBall_041813_51072059.jpg alt title=FFN_AAR_BlueBookBall_041813_51072059 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FFN_RIJ_IRON_MAN3_042413_51078052.jpg alt title=FFN_RIJ_IRON_MAN3_042413_51078052 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame/Flynet.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma3FlZoB6e8awsKedpJ2ssa3Lramor6OUrqXCyJycmJ6fp6y4u8yepZiZnpy%2FuqvWoquhl6Sdsqq%2BvqGsrJqRo7G0q44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
