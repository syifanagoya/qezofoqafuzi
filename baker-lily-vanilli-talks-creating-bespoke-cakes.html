Online </strong>at a cake decorating masterclass with&nbsp;<strong>Pinterest</strong>. "<strong>What's fun about working with celebrities is that they're very creative</strong> and give open briefs, so that gives me an opportunity to create things that are unusual and unique!"</p><p id=esBAUFUc0NXB data-wc=39>"<strong>If you're going to have a thing as indulgent as cake you want it to be exactly how you like it</strong>," she said. "That's what got me into baking, so I could really make my own kind of cake".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d7571f05f04a-cakelily-z.jpg><p id=eXDOuz9DjHGh data-wc=8><strong>Lily created a cake especially for the masterclass</strong></p><p id=ebWwWR5bfawR data-wc=38>From edible gardens to cakes shaped like crustaceans, <strong>Lily has no limits as to what she will create</strong>.&nbsp;"I'm the go-to person for weird cakes!" she laughed. "I once made a lifesize replica of a client's boyfriend's head!"</p><p id=ev6STNHZbzyu data-wc=47>"It was a surprise," she explained. "When I brought the cake I actually saw him so I had to hide. It was so weird because I'd spent 17 hours staring at photos of him to get the cake right, but he had no idea who I was!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fed64191bc7f-ediblegarden-z.jpg><p id=eHiaLPH7H6Pn data-wc=8><strong>Lily created an edible garden for Cake Britain</strong></p><p id=er1QTQyIvxwG data-wc=52>The quirky baker also admitted that her own personal preferences tended to go against the trends. "I went through a phase of making Tim Burton-esque cakes," she added. "<strong>It was my backlash to cupcakes</strong> because they were so pretty, but didn't taste very good. I like cakes that are different, but delicious."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c42a872c5d3d-cakes-z.jpg><p id=e2pUAPXKk3ff data-wc=11><strong>HELLO! Online had a go at decorating cakes with Lily's help</strong></p><p id=e1ENOvM5aNv2 data-wc=67>When it comes to making a bespoke cake, Lily admits that picking the flavour is one of the first things she asks her clients to do. "I ask people what their favourite flavours are and work from that," she said. "When people come to me without ideas, I tell them to look at my Pinterest to see what they like/don't like. Then the cake starts coming together".</p><p id=e3fKKRjdvsUw data-wc=25>"My favourite flavour at the moment is a beetroot, sweet potato and parsnip cake," she added. "I like it because itâ€™s very earthy and tasty!"</p><p id=ealkF9OIzZ4F data-wc=31><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
