I figured that because we both shared very humble upbringings with families that emigrated to this country, she would have had more humility.”</p><p>Giudice first opened up about the experience during the Gettin Real With the Housewives panel at Mohegan Sun Cabaret in Uncasville, Connecticut, on Sunday, October 29. When an audience member asked about her best and worst encounters with fellow celebrities, she recalled running into the Modern Family actress, also 45, and claimed that a Bravo publicist asked them to take a photo together.</p><p>“I never asked for a picture because I’m so not like that. I don’t care,” the Bravo star told the audience, as seen in a video obtained by <a href=#>TMZ</a>. “She didn’t want to take a picture with me. … Ugh, I can’t stand her. Sorry, I hate to say that because I’m Italian, she’s Colombian, she has an accent. She has more of an accent than me! You would think she would be nice. Like, she’s an immigrant — no, I’m just saying — she should be nice!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Giudice further alleged that Vergara stepped in front of her while taking the photo. Recounting the incident to her RHONJ costar <a href=#><strong>Danielle Staub</strong></a> at the panel, Giudice recalled thinking, “Bitch, I don’t want to take a picture with you!”</p><p>The reality star had plenty of kind words for <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>, though. “If you look at my Instagram, you know who I did take a picture with, who was so sweet too, was Jennifer Lopez,” she told the crowd. “She’s so sweet. I love her.”</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to Vergara’s rep for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnaKawKJ5xqKsnaGTmnq4rdJmm6KrkaW9sLXNrZydZZGbwaa%2BjKymn6GRYsOmvsaaqZploJ28tbuMqKdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
