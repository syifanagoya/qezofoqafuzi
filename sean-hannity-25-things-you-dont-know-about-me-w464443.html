This is a big week for <b>Sean Hannity </b>and the rest of the Fox News team, with the network marking 15 years as the top-rated cable news network. To celebrate the milestone, the <i>Hannity </i>host, 55, shares an exclusive list with <i>Us Weekly</i> of 25 surprising facts about himself. And, yes, this involves calling out a certain<i> 30 Rock </i>alum.</p><p>1. I am 100 percent Irish. All of my grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Ireland.</p><p>2. I worked my first job as a newspaper delivery boy at the age of 8. I worked my second job at the age of 12, washing dishes. A cook at age 13, busboy at 14, waiter at 15 and bartender at 17.</p><p>3. I worked in construction, laying tile, painting and framing houses for nearly a decade.</p><p>4. I started in TV with zero experience, and I was horrible at it. (Former President [<b>Barack</b>] <b>Obama </b>and former Secretary of State <b>Hillary Clinton</b> might say I still am).</p><p>5. I was fired from my first radio gig, and I admit, I was awful when I first started.</p><p>6. I am the only registered conservative TV host on cable news.</p><p>7. I’ve now hosted TV going on 21 years, and 30 years in radio.</p><p>8. I love country music. And one of my favorite books is <i>Outliers.</i></p><p>9. I love my two dogs: Gracie and Marley.</p><p>10. I drink beer with a cup of ice. Always. Coors Light or Bud Light, so I don’t get too fat. Or vodka ice with a lot of lemon and limes.</p><p>11. I was born on December 30, which also happens to be the birthday of other broadcasters, including <b>Matt Lauer</b> and <b>Meredith Vieira</b>.</p><p>12. I’m the cook in the family.</p><p>13. My favorite food is pasta, meat and potatoes.</p><p>14. I love sports — played baseball, basketball, ice hockey and roller hockey as a child.</p><p>15. One of my favorite activities is to watch my kids play tennis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sean-hannity-a040352b-66a8-4c87-a0c5-815635995c3e.jpg><p>16. When I was younger, I wanted to be actor Bobby Clarke when I grew up.</p><p>17. Then at 18, I became obsessed with politics, especially Ronald Reagan.</p><p>18. I am most proud of the fact that I thoroughly covered former President Obama during his 2008 campaign and warned everyone he would be a horrible president. And I saw the <a href=#>[<b>Donald</b>] <b>Trump</b></a><b></b> phenomenon when my liberal colleagues didn’t.</p><span class=caption></span><p>19. My favorite movies are <i>Gladiator</i>, <i>Braveheart</i>, <i>Passion of the Christ</i> and <i>It’s a Wonderful Life.</i></p><p>20. I hate wearing suits and ties and think tuxedos should be burned.</p><p>21. I love jeans, T-shirts, golf shirts, <a href=# data-link=1>sweats</a> and baseball caps. I actually wear jeans behind the anchor desk every night.</p><p>22. I have a brown belt in martial arts — a blend of Krav Maga, jujitsu and kenpo. I train four days a week.</p><p>23. The person I would most like to use my skills on is Alec Baldwin.</p><p>24. Like most media people on TV, I am overpaid. I know this because of my blue-collar roots, for which I am grateful.</p><p>25. God has blessed me way more than I deserve. I’m a sinner, not a saint.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqemZ5itaK6zaKrsmVianq1tMinnqxlqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWdmnq4gJVta21rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
