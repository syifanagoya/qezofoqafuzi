Her parents had moved to the United States in search of better employment opportunities. Ramiele had joined them in the United States a couple of years later once they had found stable jobs.</li><li>She had started getting trained in Polynesian dancing when she was in the first grade and had started singing by the time she had turned 12 years old. Soon after, she began singing for Filipino-American functions and events in the state of Florida, even opening concerts for Filipino artists and bands.</li><li>During her American Idol appearance in 2008, she was considered one of the strongest contenders for the title after her performances in the audition, voting, and Hollywood rounds. She eventually finished in 9th place overall and it had come as a surprise to many fans of the show because she had never been in the ‘Bottom 3’ before her elimination. At 4 feet and 11 inches, she is also one of the shortest singers in the history of American Idol.</li><li>Later that year, she was nominated in the category of ‘Favorite TV Personality’ at the JC Penney Asian Excellence Awards.</li><li>In November 2009, she had performed the American national anthem before the fight between <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Manny Pacquiao</a> and Miguel Ángel Cotto at the MGM Grand Las Vegas.</li><li>A few months after this, she had stated in an interview that she would pursue a career in acting if she could not become a successful professional singer. It did not turn out that way as she studied a course in nursing and later became a registered nurse.</li><p>Featured Image by Ramiele Malubay / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jquYpqGVobJuucClrJuZqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
