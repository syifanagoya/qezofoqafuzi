He is one of the most well-known but divisive authors of the recent decades. His numerous publications, roles in a few films, and television appearances all contribute to his fortune.</p><p>Till this point, Rushdie has released nine novels. They are Shalimar the Clown, The Enchantress of Florence, Midnight’s Children, Shame, The Satanic Verses, The Moor’s Last Sigh, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, Grimus, and Midnight’s Children. The most recent book was released in 2008. His majority of books have received high praise from critics. The Satanic Verses is arguably his most divisive work. Following its release, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran’s then-religious leader, issued a fatw on Radio Tehran. Numerous nations with sizable Muslim populations continue to forbid the book’s publication. His life has also been the target of attempts. Rushdie, though, is still alive and working.</p><p>Rushdie has also authored nonfiction, nonfiction essays, and children’s novels. He has won numerous accolades and recognitions for his work over the years. A few of them include the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain Award for Children’s Fiction, the Booker Prise for Fiction, the Golden PEN Award, the James Joyce Award at University College Dublin, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Honorary Professorship, the Premio Grinzane Cavour (Italy), and the Author of the Year (British Book Awards).</p><p>In 2007, he was knighted for his contributions to literature. On the Queen’s birthday, he received it. Salman Rushdie’s honour was criticised by Al-Qaeda. According to Al-Qaeda, it was “an insult to Islam”.</p><h2 class=net-profile_section_title>STATISTICS</h2><ul class=net-profile_stats_list readability=-0.5><li><h3>Source of Wealth:</h3><p>Books</p></li><li><h3>Age:</h3><p>73</p></li><li><h3>Birth Place:</h3><p>Mumbai, India</p></li><li><h3>Height:</h3><p>1.7 m (5′ 7″)</p></li><li><h3>Weight:</h3><p>187 lbs (85 kg)</p></li><li><h3>Marital Status:</h3><p>Divorced (Padma Lakshmi)</p></li><li><h3>Full Name:</h3><p>Ahmad Salman Rushdie</p></li><li><h3>Nationality:</h3><p>Indian</p></li><li><h3>Date of Birth:</h3><p>June 19, 1947</p></li><li><h3>Ethnicity:</h3><p>Indian</p></li><li><h3>Occupation:</h3><p>Author</p></li><li readability=2><h3>Education:</h3><p>King’s College, University of Cambridge, Rugby School, Cathedral and John Connon School</p></li><li readability=8.5><h3>Children:</h3><p>2 (Zafar and Milan)</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Book Sales Sep. 2017</strong>Sales of the book The Golden House: A Novel (approximately 9 thousand copies sold in its first week of release)</p><p>$105,750</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Book Sales Jul. 2016</strong>Sales of the book Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights: A Novel (approximately 9 thousand copies sold in its first week of release)</p><p>$97,830</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Earning Turned Donation Sep. 2015</strong>Donation of Hilary Mantel, Salman Rushdie and David Nicholls’ bestsellers to Waterstones migration crisis appeal</p><p>$1,400,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Earnings May. 2005</strong>Prize for his book Shalimar the Clown that received the Crossword Book Award</p><p>$5,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Book Sales Mar. 2000</strong>Sales of the book The Ground Beneath Her Feet: A Novel (approximately 9 thousand copies sold in its first week of release)</p><p>$81,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Book Sales May. 1998</strong>Sales of the book The Satanic Verses: A Novel (approximately 9 thousand copies sold in its first week of release)</p><p>$69,480</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Royalties 1990</strong>Estimated earnings during the first two years of publication of The Satanic Verses</p><p>$2,000,000</p><p><strong class=earnings-data_text_title>Earnings Jan. 1981</strong>Prize for his book Midnight’s Children that received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize</p><p>$8,380</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiqmqSdlrtuvtSsn52hlWK7psDWqKmtoF2dvLh50aKaoWWZqHq0rcummKdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
