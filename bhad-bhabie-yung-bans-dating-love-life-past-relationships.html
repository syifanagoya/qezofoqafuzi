When Bhabie posted a picture of her new hair color on Instagram, her fans were quick to notice Yung Bans.</p><p>Bhabieâ€™s fans were upset about the couple dating as Bhabie is just 17 years old, and her partner, Bans, is nearly 21 years old. They <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a> that the relationship was illegal. But Bregoli was quick to respond that there was nothing illegal about their relationship, and the three year age difference cannot make someone get charge.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by BhabieðŸ¦‹ (@bhadbhabie)</a> on Apr 16, 2020 at 3:25pm PDT</p><p>Furthermore, Bhabie firmly clarified that the age of consent is 17 in Atlanta. Bhabie further defended her boyfriend, claiming that they were not breaking any rules.</p><p>Looks like Bhad Bhabieâ€™s boyfriend, Yung Bans, is making her exclusively happy, and they are in a serious relationship. Daniel has been under public scrutiny since she was very young; it is easy for people to judge her actions without a second thought. Well, that includes invading her privacy at peak.</p><p>However, Bhad Bhabie and her partner are seeking privacy and are off social media for a few days. Letâ€™s hope they are doing good and are career-focused at the same time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bregoli_Was_Rumored_With_A_Few_Rappers></span>Bregoli Was Rumored With A Few Rappers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aforementioned, Bregoli has been under the publicâ€™s eye since she was pretty young. Therefore, her life is exclusively out there. Furthermore, because of her interest in the rap world, she has been linked with rappers like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>YoungBoy</a>, Kodak Blak, etc. to name a few.</p><p>Rumors regarding Danielle Bregoli,14, and <strong>Kodak Black</strong> 20 at the time sparked when she appeared in Blackâ€™s â€˜Everything 1kâ€™ music video in 2017. Danielle came up clean, clearing the air about the relationship, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">claimed that nothing</a> happened. She confessed that people would assume about her relationship when she would simply take pictures or talk to them.</p><p>Bhad Bhabie also sparked rumors when she got a tattoo of rapper <strong>YoungBoy</strong>â€˜s initials on her hand. She was quick to clear the air in that situation as well.</p><p>The young woman is growing up. Sheâ€™s just 17 and is discovering life in her manner. Therefore, unnecessary critics regarding her personal life seem useless.</p><p>For now, letâ€™s hope Bhad Bhabieâ€™s boyfriend, Yung Bans is doing well, and they are enjoying a proper private time at the moment.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Movies & T.V.
