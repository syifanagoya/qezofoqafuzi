Destiny was evident from her very initials, with "CI" perhaps standing for "Charming Icon" or "Chic Individual." She spent her formative years growing up in Los Angeles, where the buzz of Hollywood beckoned, but the runways of Paris and Milan would first claim her. With her arresting eyes and unmistakable strut, this Southern-born belle quickly saw her stock rise in the global modeling industry. And, just to tease your financial senses early on, as of 2023, Chanel Iman is worth a cool <strong>$9 million</strong>, according to <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CelebrityNetWorth</a></strong>.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-struts-snaps-showstopping-moments>Struts, Snaps, & Showstopping Moments</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CA - JULY 23: Model Chanel Iman attends the Hudson Jeans FYF Fest Style Lounge.

By 2006, Vogue declared her one of the "World's Next Top Models," an accolade not distributed lightly. Our star has since graced the catwalks for illustrious brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, and Balenciaga. The crowning jewel? Being a Victoria's Secret Angel, where she flitted from 2010 to 2012. Her mesmerizing runway presence made her not just another model but an embodiment of art in motion.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Behind the Gloss: Personal Narratives</h2></span><p>BRIDGEHAMPTON, NY - JULY 22: Chanel Iman, Elsa Hosk, Travis Scott, and Josephine Skriver attend the FIJI Water at #REVOLVEintheHamptons 2017 on July 22, 2017 in Bridgehampton, New York.

Tying the knot with New York Giants' Sterling Shepard in 2018, the duo became one of the young power couples in the celebrity ecosystem. Their union has blessed two children, Cali and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Cassie</a>, bringing forth the soft maternal shades of Chanel's persona. The pair <a href=# rel>have since separated</a>. Passionate about charity, she's also known to advocate for children in need, proving that heart and haute couture can go hand in hand.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Golden Ventures: More Than Just A Pretty Face</h2></span><p>PARIS, FRANCE - JUNE 23: Chanel Iman and Davon Godchaux attend the Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring Summer 2023 show.
